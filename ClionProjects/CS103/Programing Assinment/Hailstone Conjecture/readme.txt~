================================ Questions ==================================

:A while loop because as the program goes on we are trying to get the value
to be quivalent to one. Once it does equal one, we can continue to the rest
of the code. 


  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |       6        |     64      |      118       |     97      
   100 200     |       7        |    128      |      124       |    171      
   200 400     |       8        |    256      |      143       |    327      

:The are always even, because it will always end with "4, 2, 1". Meaning that
no matter what we will always need an even number to get to the number 4. 
If we start with an odd, there is always one more step to make the number 
you are working with to be even. Which is where we would be if we started 
with an even number.  


X is : 703

3b. Explain, briefly, the way in which you used your hailstats program
(i.e., which inputs you gave it) to find this answer.

: I changed my hail stats program to output the value of loops only when 
th number of loops is greater than 150. But after I did that I saw that 
the the Minimum Lenth (mL) is ways

Do you have any other remarks?
