:A while loop because as the program goes on we are trying to get the value
to be quivalent to one. Once it does equal one, we can continue to the rest
of the code.


  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |       6        |     64      |      118       |     97
   100 200     |       7        |    128      |      124       |    171      
   200 400     |       8        |    256      |      143       |    327    



:The "Achived by" input will always be 2^(minLenght). For example, the input for a sequence with the lenth 10, will be lots of things, but if the range is double the predisessor (like in the prolem aboce) the range would be 800-1600. If this were the case then the input (once agian, for this range) would be 2^10, which equals 1024, and that would be the input to acheive the lenth 10.

:I changed my hail stats program to output the value of loops only when 
th number of loops is greater than 150. After that I ran the values to be 
between 1 and 10000, and got a long list of values that will produce lengths
longer than 150, and the first value that would do as such was 703.

I did this lab maybe a week ago, but got due dates mixed up in my head 
and because of such am turning it in today (Wednesday the 3rd) even though 
I have had it done. I will take one of my two "grace days" for this assinment.
